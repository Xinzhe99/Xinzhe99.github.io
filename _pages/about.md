I am a PhD candidate at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn), specializing in **Artificial Intelligence** with research focus on **Multi-modal Algorithms (T2I, TI2I, VLA)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Generative Image Algorithms**. My work centers on developing advanced computer vision techniques, particularly in multi-focus image fusion, leveraging deep learning, transformers, and state space models.

## Research Interests
* Multi-modal Large Models (Text-to-Image, Text-guided Image-to-Image, Vision-Language-Action)
* Generative Image Algorithms (Diffusion Models, GANs)
* Multi-focus Image Fusion
* Deep Learning (CNNs, Transformers, State Space Models)
* Microscopic Image Processing
* Computer Vision

## Recent News
