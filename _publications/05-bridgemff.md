This paper introduces BridgeMFF, a visual state space model-based network addressing the challenge of determining focus status in flat regions. The method introduces BridgeTune, a general fine-tuning technique leveraging dual adversarial learning to bridge semantic and texture gaps. With only 0.05M parameters (0.09s per image), the method achieves highly efficient real-time fusion.
