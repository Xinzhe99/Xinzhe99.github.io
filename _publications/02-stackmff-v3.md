This paper proposes StackMFF V3, the third-generation general stack-based fusion model addressing the limitation of previous models relying on ordered inputs. It innovatively designs Pyramid Fusion MLP and pixel-level cross-layer attention modules to efficiently capture dependencies without focus order priors.
