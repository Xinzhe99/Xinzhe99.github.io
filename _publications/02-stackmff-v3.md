---

This paper proposes StackMFF V3, the third-generation general stack-based fusion model addressing the limitation of previous models relying on ordered inputs. It innovatively designs Pyramid Fusion MLP and pixel-level cross-layer attention modules to efficiently capture intra-layer and inter-layer dependencies without focus order priors. By modeling the fusion task as pixel-level multi-classification, the method completely eliminates input constraints. Experiments demonstrate strong versatility with state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
