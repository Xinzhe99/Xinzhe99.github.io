StackMFF presents an end-to-end deep learning framework for multi-focus image stack fusion using 3D CNN. To address the challenge of training data scarcity, we construct a synthetic data generation pipeline based on monocular depth estimation. The method introduces 3D attention mechanisms and composite loss functions for model optimization. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both speed and quality, establishing a strong benchmark for multi-focus stack fusion tasks.
