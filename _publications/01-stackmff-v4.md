This paper proposes StackMFF V4, a two-stage generative fusion framework addressing the challenges of missing focal planes and edge artifacts in existing methods. The method cascades a deterministic integration module with IFControlNet based on Latent Diffusion Model, leveraging generative priors to reconstruct missing focal plane content and eliminate edge artifacts. Experiments demonstrate effective resolution of detail loss in complex scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art fusion performance.
