This paper introduces LightMFF, an ultra-lightweight multi-focus image fusion network addressing the high computational resource requirements of existing methods. We innovatively reconstruct the fusion task from classification perspective to refinement perspective, utilizing edge guidance to simplify the architecture. With only 0.02M parameters and 0.06G FLOPs (98% computational reduction), and 0.02s per image inference, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining extreme efficiency.
