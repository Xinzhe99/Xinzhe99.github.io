This paper proposes an underwater microscopic imaging system addressing the challenges of micro-monitoring in complex seabed environments. The system introduces an electrically tunable lens enabling dynamic working distance adjustment. Combined with image fusion algorithms, the system reconstructs high-definition all-focus images from image stacks. With micron-level resolution, the system achieves long-term in-situ real-time monitoring of benthic organisms.
