This paper presents SwinMFF, a multi-focus image fusion framework based on the pure Swin Transformer architecture, addressing the fidelity insufficiency caused by pixel regression errors. By capturing long-range dependencies between images, the method significantly reduces regression errors, effectively suppressing edge artifacts.
