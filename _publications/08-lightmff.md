This paper introduces LightMFF, an ultra-lightweight multi-focus image fusion network addressing high computational requirements. We innovatively reconstruct the fusion task from classification perspective to refinement perspective. With only 0.02M parameters and 0.06G FLOPs (98% reduction), and 0.02s per image inference.
