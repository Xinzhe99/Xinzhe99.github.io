This paper presents SwinMFF, a multi-focus image fusion framework based on the pure Swin Transformer architecture, addressing the fidelity insufficiency caused by pixel regression errors in existing end-to-end methods. By capturing long-range dependencies between images, the method significantly reduces regression errors, effectively suppressing edge artifacts and achieving high-fidelity fusion. Large-scale experiments demonstrate superiority over 28 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective metrics.
