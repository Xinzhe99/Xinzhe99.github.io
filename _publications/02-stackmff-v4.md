This paper proposes StackMFF V4, a two-stage generative fusion framework addressing the challenges of missing focal planes and edge artifacts. The method cascades a deterministic integration module with IFControlNet based on Latent Diffusion Model, leveraging generative priors to reconstruct missing focal plane content.
