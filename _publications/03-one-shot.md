This paper proposes StackMFF V2, a one-shot framework reconstructing the fusion task as focal-plane depth regression to address error accumulation and computational inefficiency in existing methods. The method designs a three-stage network architecture using differentiable soft regression strategy with depth maps as proxy supervision signals, achieving end-to-end training without manual annotations. Experiments on 5 public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with extremely low computational overhead.
